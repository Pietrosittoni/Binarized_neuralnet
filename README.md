# Binarized_neuralnet
Binarized nueral network are a particular class feed forward neural network in which the weights, inputs and outputs can only take value in {-1, 1}.
This allows both the training and evaluation phase of the network to be transformed into a maximum satisfiability problem.
We show how to rappresent 1-layer and 2-layer FFNN with propositional logic, and how to trasform the training/evaluation phase into maximum satisfiability problem.
Therfore, we try to approximate some Boolean function with our neural nets.
